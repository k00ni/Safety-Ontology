# Safety Ontology
This is an ontology for extracting the safety knowledge in industry 4.0. It is developed using Protégé and OWL. For detailed description of the ontology and its development procedure the following publication can be reviewed:

Teimourikia, Mahsa and Mariagrazia Fugini. "Ontology Development for Run-Time Safety Management Methodology in Smart Work Environments Using Ambient Knowledge." Future Generation Computer Systems, Elsevier Editor, 2016.

This ontology may be downloaded and used in different applications and works with the proper citations. I would also ask to be notified of the changes and further developments applied on this ontology.
